# ExpBuild CLI Configuration Example

## Remote execution service endpoints
[remote]
# Main execution engine endpoint (required)
engine_address = "grpc://localhost:8980"

# Optional: separate CAS and action cache endpoints
# cas_address = "grpc://localhost:8981"
# action_cache_address = "grpc://localhost:8982"

# Optional: instance name for the remote execution service
# instance_name = "main"

## TLS Configuration
[tls]
# Enable TLS (default: false)
enabled = false

# Path to CA certificates
# ca_certs = "/path/to/ca-certificates.crt"

# Path to client certificate (for mutual TLS)
# client_cert = "/path/to/client-cert.pem"

## gRPC Configuration
[grpc]
# Keepalive ping interval in seconds (default: 30)
keepalive_time_secs = 30

# Keepalive timeout in seconds (default: 10)
keepalive_timeout_secs = 10

# Send keepalive pings even when there are no active calls (default: true)
keepalive_while_idle = true

# Maximum message size for decoding in bytes
# max_decoding_message_size = 4194304
